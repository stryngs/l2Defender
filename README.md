# l2Defender
l2Defender is an IDS/IPS for Layer 2 of the OSI model.

## Concepts
ARP was chosen as the initial protocol to watch for abuse.  The module for this is still under development.

Once the ARP modularity has been finalized it will then serve as a template going forward for other modules.

## Next things to do
- Audible alerting
- Monitor mode
- Reactive modules
- Boolean refinement for detections
